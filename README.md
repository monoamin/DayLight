# --------------------
## An addon-mod for HourGlass and SereneSeasons.
- Dynamically adjusts the day and night lengths based on time of year.
- Compatible with client and server (only the server needs the mod).
- Configurable by config file through specifying latitude and axial tilt
  
### Todo:
- integrate with mod menu config screen
- make calculation more granular (ingame day instead of ingame month)
- alter sun azimuth and altitude (possibly through existing methods such as shaders)
