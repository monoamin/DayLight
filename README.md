## An addon for HourGlass and SereneSeasons
- Dynamically adjusts the day and night lengths based on ingame season
- Compatible with client and server (only the server needs the mod).
- Configurable parameters include latitude, axial tilt, and cycle duration. 
  
### Todo:
- integrate with mod menu config screen
- make calculation more granular (ingame day instead of ingame month)
- alter sun azimuth and altitude (possibly through existing methods such as shaders)
